# A-New-Multimodal-Fusion-Scheme-Based-on-Heterogeneous-Biometrics-Data
unpublished


In this paper, we present a new fusion scheme that combine
two biometrics modalities which have different nature (image
and signal). The first proposed method allows producing a 
new biometric data by combining ear biometric image and
keystroke dynamics features using convolution. The second
proposed technique present a new score level fusion scheme
which combine ear biometrics, keystroke dynamics and the
new biometric data produced using the first proposed method.
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used in the proposed score level
fusion scheme in order to find the optimum weights associated
to the modalities being fused.
